OMG, okay, so I just finished watching The Ballad of Wallis Island, and man, what a rollercoaster! You ever feel like a movie just slaps you upside the head with a plot twist you didn't see coming? That's exactly what happened here. My brain's still kinda spinning, you know what I mean?

Like, first of all, I'm thinking it's just gonna be this chill island drama—typical stuff—but then BAM! That whole thing with the treasure under the antique shop? Seriously, was NOT expecting that. I'm sitting here, popcorn in hand, minding my own business, when suddenly I'm yelling at the screen. Oh well, at least I didn’t download the movie! 

And what about those characters?! You know, Marianne or whatever her name was? I'm screaming at her through my TV, GIRL, stop trusting that sleazy sailor dude! 🤦‍♀️ I'd love to know who writes this stuff because holy plot twist, Batman!

> I swear, sometimes I think these movies just insert drama for the sake of it, but at the same time, I couldn’t stop watching. It's like a bad car accident—you just can't look away, right? Anyway, there's this one scene where they do this ridiculous dance number on the beach, which was SO random but, like, I was kind of living for it secretly?

And don't EVEN get me started on the ending. I’m not giving spoilers, but can we just talk about how everyone mysteriously ended up happily ever after with zero explanation? It’s like they ran out of film or something. Like, hello, consistency, where are you? But I guess that’s half the fun of these things.

By the way, do you remember if I told you to watch the movie? Maybe it was just my boring old texts again. 😂 You have to see it just for the chaos and giggles, trust me. 

function randomThought() { return What even was that ending? }

So I guess that's where I'm at right now. Guess I'll just have to distract myself until this insanity fades out of my head. Anyway, let me know when you're ready for a debrief of this madness. We have so much to dissect!
